This project demonstrates the fundamentals of building a production-ready AWS VPC from scratch.  
A VPC is a virtual network that closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center.
Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) are regional-specific.
VPCs are isolated networks.
It includes public and private subnets across multiple AZs, route tables, IGW/NAT design, and VPC Flow Logs.  
The goal is to understand traffic flow, subnet isolation, and core AWS networking concepts used in real architectures.
